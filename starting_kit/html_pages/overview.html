<p>
    This is a living species classification problem. This type of problem is very important due to the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It provides a way of identifying different groups of organisms.
    </li>
    <li>
        It gives internationally recognized way of referring to a particular organism.
    </li>
    <li>
        It helps in quantifying biodiversity because if these organisms can be identified,
        then the way their population changes over time can be monitored.
        This helps in conservation of living organisms.
    </li>
    <li>
        It enables scientists to explain how different organisms are related to each other.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The problem contains three different datasets:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Dataset0, which is a flowers dataset, contains 102 classes, between 39 and 250 instances each,
        where each class refers to a type of flower.
    </li>
    <li>
        Dataset1 and Dataset2, that are made of 129 and 142 classes respectively,
        and contain 33 912 and 35 371 trainig samples each.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We used an auto-ML procedure to evaluate the model that you will develop, more details in the <strong>Evaluation</strong> tab.
