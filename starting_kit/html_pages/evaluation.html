    Evaluation
</h1>
<p>
    The problem is a multiclass classification problem.
    Each sample is an image of 128x128.
    You must predict the species of the living being present on the images. <br />
    You are given for training a Dataset0 containing 8169 images of dimension 128x128 and a csv file of the labels for every image.
    More info on the <strong>Data</strong> tab. You must developp a model to perform multiclass classification on this Dataset.
    For phases 1 and 2, Dataset1 and Dataset2 will be used to evaluate your model but they are entirely private. <br />
    There are 3 phases:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Phase 0: public phase.</strong> We provide you with Dataset0 containing labeled data.
        You will not be evaluated on this dataset, but it will be used to developp the model that you will then submit for other 2 phases.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Phase 1: development phase.</strong> This time you do not have access to any part of the Dataset1 which will be used to
        train and test on the model you submitted.
        The performance of your LAST submission on the test set will be displayed on the leaderboard.
        You will be allowed 5 submissions a day and 100 total.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Phase 2: final phase.</strong> This will follow the same procedure as phase 1 but with the Dataset2.
        And you will only have a single submissions to assess your final performance on the challenge.
        Your performance on the test set will appear on the leaderboard when the organizers finish checking the submissions
        ensuring there is no cheating involved.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>This sample competition allows you to submit either:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A prediction model that must be trained and tested on the dataset of the phase 1/2.</li>
    <li>A pre-trained model that must be re-trained and tested on the dataset of the phase 1/2.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The submissions are evaluated using the <strong>f1-score</strong> metric.
    This metric will be weighted to account for class imbalances. <br />
    We used this metric as it is the harmonic mean between precision and recall and since there is no
    class more important than the others,precision and recall are equally important.
